# Deep Learning Project: AI-Powered Image Similarity Search and Recommendation System

## About

This project implements an AI-powered image similarity search and recommendation system for fashion products. Using deep learning techniques, it allows users to upload an image of a fashion item and retrieve similar products from a dataset. The system leverages embeddings generated by a trained model and FAISS for efficient similarity search.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building the API
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model inference
- **FAISS**: Library for efficient similarity search
- **Pillow**: Image processing library
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library built on Radix UI
- **React Hook Form**: Library for form handling

## Dataset

The project uses the [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains images of various fashion products categorized into different types.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of fashion items
- **Similarity Search**: Finds the most similar products based on the uploaded image
- **Product Recommendations**: Displays top-k similar products with images
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Fast Search**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient vector similarity search

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or bun

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies (using npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using bun (if available):
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using bun:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`

### Running the Application

1. Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running
2. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
3. Upload an image and see similar product recommendations
